                            Wait, the previous files had this nested structure which I'm replicating to match style.
                            Actually, putting BrandRating here makes it part of the grid if not carefully placed.
                            However, based on CorrugatedBoxes, it seems they want it nested in that main container structure.
                            But standard practice suggests breaking out of the 2-col grid.
                            Ref CorrugatedBoxes: It was inside layout. I will place it after the grid for better structure here, 
                            but to match previous files I might need to conform. 
                            Let's place it outside the grid logic -> actually CorrugatedBoxes had a weird structure. 
                            I'll stick to a clean structure here: Grid for Hero, then new Sections.

                <h3>Unmatched Material Quality & Durability</h3>
                <p>
                    The foundation of exceptional packaging lies in the materials used. We offer a diverse spectrum of stocks to suit different weight requirements and aesthetic preferences:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Corrugated Cardboard:</strong> Ideal for shipping and heavy-duty protection. Available in various flute sizes (E-flute, B-flute) to balance strength and printability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rigid Board:</strong> The epitome of luxury. This thick, unbending material is perfect for high-end gift sets, electronics, and premium cosmetics, often paired with magnetic closures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kraft Stock:</strong> An eco-friendly favorite. Biodegradable and recyclable, it offers a natural, rustic look that appeals to environmentally conscious consumers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cardstock (SBS/C1S):</strong> Lightweight and highly printable, making it perfect for retail shelves, cosmetics, and food packaging where graphical fidelity is paramount.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Each material is tested for compression strength and edge crush resistance, ensuring your products arrive at their destination in pristine condition, regardless of the shipping rigors.
                </p>

                <h3>Advanced Printing & Finishing Options</h3>
                <p>
                    Transform your packaging into a work of art with our state-of-the-art printing capabilities. We utilize advanced offset and digital printing technologies to achieve vibrant, color-accurate results (CMYK & Pantone) that make your logo and artwork pop.
                    Beyond standard printing, we offer a suite of premium finishing options to add tactile and visual depth:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Spot UV:</strong> Create a striking contrast by adding a high-gloss coating to specific areas like logos or patterns against a matte background.</li>
                    <li><strong>Foil Stamping:</strong> Add a touch of elegance with metallic gold, silver, or holographic foils that catch the light and convey luxury.</li>
                    <li><strong>Embossing & Debossing:</strong> Add dimension to your packaging with raised (embossed) or recessed (debossed) elements for a premium tactile feel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Matte & Gloss Lamination:</strong> Choose Soft-Touch Matte for a velvety smooth feel or High-Gloss for a vibrant, shiny finish that protects against scuffs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Comprehensive Size & Shape Customization</h3>
                <p>
                    One size does not fit all. We specialize in fully bespoke structural design. Whether you need a standard tuck-end box, a complex mailer with inserts, or a unique geometric shape to stand out on the shelf, we can engineer it.
                    Our CAD specialists work with you to create die-lines that fit your product perfectly—minimizing movement and preventing damage.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Custom Inserts:</strong> Foam, cardboard, or molded pulp inserts custom-shaped to hold your product securely in place.</li>
                    <li><strong>Window Cutouts:</strong> transparent PET windows to let customers see the product inside, building trust and driving sales.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unique Closures:</strong> Magnetic catches, ribbon ties, tuck-tops, and auto-lock bottoms for convenience and security.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Wholesale Benefits & Scalability</h3>
                <p>
