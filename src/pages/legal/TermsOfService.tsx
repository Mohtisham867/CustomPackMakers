                                <li><strong>Digital Proofs:</strong> We provide digital proofs for your approval before production begins. Once a proof is approved, the order enters production, and no further changes can be made. We are not responsible for errors that were present in the approved proof.</li>
                                <li><strong>Color Accuracy:</strong> While we strive for color accuracy, due to the limitations of CMYK printing and screen calibration, we cannot guarantee a 100% color match to what you see on your screen. Slight variations may occur.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tolerances:</strong> Standard industry production tolerances for cutting, folding, and gluing apply (typically &plusmn; 1/16 inch).</li>
